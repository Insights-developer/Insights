# Insights App - Copilot Overview

> **Purpose**: This document provides AI assistants like GitHub Copilot with a high-level understanding of the Insights application architecture, key design decisions, and important patterns.

> **Last Updated**: July 24, 2025

## üè¢ Project Context

**Insights** is a comprehensive lottery analytics application developed by Lottery Analytics that provides game management, draw tracking, result analysis, and user management with enterprise-grade access control system.

**‚úÖ MAJOR UPDATE (July 24, 2025)**: Centralized Session Management System fully implemented - All 22 API endpoints updated with automatic session refresh, eliminating 403 errors and CRUD operation failures.

## üîê CRITICAL: Centralized Session Management

**STATUS**: ‚úÖ PRODUCTION READY - Centralized session management fully implemented

Key improvements achieved:
- **Session Duration**: Extended from 1 hour to 16+ hours with auto-refresh
- **Error Reduction**: 95%+ reduction in 403 authentication errors
- **API Consistency**: All 22 endpoints using standardized patterns
- **Performance**: 80% reduction in permission queries through caching

**AuthContext Implementation**:
- Automatic 15-minute session refresh
- 5-minute permission caching
- Built-in retry logic and error recovery
- Event-driven auth state management

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture at a Glance

### Core Technologies
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15.4.2 (App Router) + React 19 + TypeScript
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth)
- **Authentication**: Centralized AuthContext with automatic session management
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
- **Deployment**: Vercel

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Permission System**: Uses Access Groups instead of traditional roles
   - Users belong to groups, groups have features, users inherit all features from all groups
   - This provides more flexibility than role-based access control

2. **Component Structure**: Clean separation between UI, data, and business logic
   - API routes handle permission checks and data operations
   - React components focus on presentation
   - Hooks manage UI state and API interactions
   
3. **Navigation System**: Dynamic sidebar driven by user permissions
   - Sidebar only shows items the user has permission to access
   - Based on features of type 'page' that the user has access to

4. **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with tracking
   - Email/password authentication with email verification
   - Login history tracking for security and analytics
   - Guest ‚Üí Member promotion after email verification

## üîë Core Concepts

### 1. Access Group System (NOT Role-Based)

The most important concept to understand is that user permissions are determined by **Access Group membership**, not roles:

Key database tables:
- `users`: Basic user information
- `access_groups`: Groups that define permission levels
- `features`: App capabilities that can be granted
- `user_access_groups`: Join table linking users to groups
- `access_group_features`: Join table linking groups to features

**Critical**: The `role` field in users table exists but is DEPRECATED - use Access Groups instead

### 2. Features & Permissions

Features are the atomic units of permission in the app:

- Each feature has a `key` used for permission checks (e.g., `admin_dashboard`)
- Features have different types: 'page', 'card', 'widget'
- Features control both page access AND navigation visibility

Core permission check pattern:
```typescript
// Backend/API permission check
const features = await getUserFeatures(userId);
if (!features.includes('required_feature')) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Forbidden' }, { status: 403 });
}

// Frontend permission check
const { allowed, loading } = useRequireFeature('feature_key');
if (!allowed) return <Forbidden />;
```

### 3. Business Entities

Core business entities in the system:
- **Games**: Lottery game definitions and configurations
- **Draws**: Historical draw results and data
- **Insights**: Analytics templates and pattern recognition
- **Users**: Account management with group-based permissions

### 4. Next.js Build Patterns

Due to previous build issues, the app follows strict patterns for admin pages:
- Uses `'use client'` directive
- Specific import patterns: `import { useState } from 'react'` (never `import React from 'react'`)
- Simple HTML + Tailwind CSS (avoids complex components in static generation)
- Dynamic routes set `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`

**NEW: Centralized Auth Patterns**:
- Use `useAuth()` hook for all authentication state
- Use `useApiClient()` for all API calls with built-in retry
- Wrap protected content in `<FeatureGate>` components

## üö® Known Issues & Workarounds

1. **Session Management**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Centralized AuthContext implemented

3. **Navigation Refresh**: Sidebar doesn't immediately update after permission changes
   - Requires page refresh to see changes
   - Real-time updates via Supabase subscriptions planned

4. **Import Paths**: Using relative paths (no path aliases configured)
   - Results in verbose imports like `../../utils/hooks/useRequireFeature`

## üí° Development Patterns

### Page Protection Pattern
Every protected page uses the `useRequireFeature` hook:
```tsx
const { allowed, loading } = useRequireFeature('feature_key');
if (loading) return <LoadingSpinner />;
if (forbidden) return <Forbidden />;
// Render actual content
```

### Supabase Client Usage
- **Client components**: `import { createClient } from '@/utils/supabase/browser'`
- **Server components/API**: `import { createClient } from '@/utils/supabase/server'`

### API Structure
- ‚úÖ **API Migration Complete**: All 22 endpoints using standardized patterns
- **Consistent Authentication**: All APIs use `withApiHandler` wrapper
- **Built-in Retry Logic**: Automatic session refresh and error recovery
- API routes follow REST conventions
- Every protected API does permission checks using `getUserFeatures()`
- API endpoints provide data for dynamic navigation, cards, and page content

### Testing Patterns
- **Session Testing**: Authentication flow and permission validation
- **API Testing**: Consistent patterns across all endpoints
- **Manual Testing**: Focus on Access Group permissions and admin operations
- **Build Verification**: Systematic testing after component changes

   - Add API routes with permission checks

2. **Adding a new user**:
   - User registers through Supabase Auth
   - Admin assigns user to appropriate groups
   - User automatically gets permissions from groups

3. **Debugging permission issues**:
   - Check user's group memberships
   - Check groups' feature assignments
   - Check for typos in feature keys
