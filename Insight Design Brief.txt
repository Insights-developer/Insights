Project Brief: Insights (as of July 20, 2025)
What Has Been Implemented
* Dynamic Navigation & Admin Dashboard
* Nav and admin dashboards are now fully powered by feature metadata (RBAC-driven) from the database.
* No links are hardcoded; adding/removing features from the admin instantly updates nav/dash for authorized users.
* Navbar auto-refreshes after admin CRUD, with absolute URL fixes.
* Feature & Access Group Management
* Complete CRUD for features and access groups, with RBAC integration.
* Features can be set as “card”, “page”, etc., and have icons, URLs, and order fields.
* Group-feature assignments and user-group management are handled through the admin UI.
* All controls tested for proper access enforcement.
* UI & Design System Overhaul
* Universal design system scaffolded: Card, Button, Icon, Avatar, Notification, ThemeProvider, and theme tokens.
* Tailwind CSS (v3/v4-compatible) integrated with tokens and utility classes.
* Global styles/typography aligned to a clean, scalable brand standard (Resend-inspired): cards for features, animated icons, notification system, and well-structured user/profile UI.
* Per-page CSS eliminated; styles are now entirely component/token–driven and automatically apply to all new features/pages.
* Authentication & Public Flows
* Login page rebuilt as a full-featured, accessible, multi-tab public landing page with registration, password reset, and email verification flows; all using Supabase.
* All new auth screens and forms are on-brand, responsive, and leverage the core design system.
* Login required for any app access; public entrypoint is /app/login/page.tsx.
* API Endpoints
* Dynamic endpoints for user nav/cards based on RBAC.
* /api/contact endpoint: validates and sends contact submissions to developer email using Resend’s test domain.
* Code/permission checks for all endpoints.
What's Still Needed / Next Steps
* Visual/Functional Polish
* Continue migrating legacy pages/components to the new design system (Card, Button, etc.).
* Expand animated icon support and ensure all dynamic cards/pages display correct visual flair.
* User Dashboard Enhancements
* Implement user dashboard with dynamic, RBAC-powered cards/widgets, not just admin/dashboard.
* Add per-user card rearrangement (drag-and-drop save).
* Notifications
* Build or integrate a real notification delivery/consumption system (in-app toasts and historical view).
* Contact Handling
* Future: Admin console for viewing contact form submissions (currently just email).
* Expand notification settings for more destinations as business needs.
* Access Control and QA
* Confirm RBAC is respected everywhere (API endpoints, UI, and navigation).
* Systematic audits for any legacy or per-page CSS to finalize style unification.
* Developer/Owner Documentation
* Continue/complete documentation/checklists for adding new features, cards, or pages—no code/style duplication or one-off CSS allowed.
* Reference onboarding, feature assignment, and style integration for new devs.
Dev/Process Notes
* All code contributions should use the new design system and themed UI primitives by default.
* Avoid all per-page CSS; styles must be tokenized/shared.
* When expanding features (cards/pages), verify admin CRUD and navigation propagate changes fully.
* Provide direct and actionable feedback for code issues/fixes.

Continue: Next item is further page/app migration to design system, animated icons, user dashboard RBAC cards, or any unsolved polish as prioritized.
