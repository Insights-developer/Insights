# Project Update: Next.js 15+ Migration and Dashboard Redesign (July 26, 2025)

## Summary
- Migrated all main pages (`dashboard`, `insights`, `settings`, `contact`, `games`, `profile`, `admin`) into a Next.js 15+ route group: `(main)`.
- Implemented suspense boundaries and a dedicated layout for the `(main)` group, including a collapsible sidebar and persistent user info box.
- Removed all duplicate and obsolete page directories/files from the old structure.
- Restored real page implementations for all main pages, replacing re-export stubs.
- Fixed all build errors, including route conflicts, module not found, and React hook usage issues.
- Ensured correct usage of `"use client"` and server/client component boundaries for all pages.
- Ran `npm run build` multiple times to verify a clean, error-free build.
- Only minor ESLint warnings remain (unused variables in some API routes/components).

## Details

### 1. Route Group Migration
- All main user-facing pages are now under `/src/app/(main)/`.
- The root layout (`/src/app/layout.tsx`) is minimal and delegates to `(main)`.
- `/src/app/(main)/layout.tsx` provides the sidebar, user info, and suspense boundaries.
- Suspense fallback and not-found pages are implemented in `(main)`.

### 2. Cleanup
- Removed all old `/src/app/[dashboard|insights|settings|contact|games|profile|admin]/` directories and files.
- Removed all re-export stubs and duplicate files.

### 3. Page Implementations
- Restored real code for all main pages in `(main)`.
- Ensured `dashboard/page.tsx` is a client component (added `"use client"` as needed).
- Verified all other pages have correct client/server boundaries.

### 4. Build & Linting
- Ran `npm run build` after each major change.
- Fixed all build errors (route conflicts, module not found, suspense, React hook usage).
- Final build is successful; only minor ESLint warnings remain (can be cleaned up later).

### 5. UI/UX Improvements
- Dashboard features a modern, collapsible sidebar and user info box.
- Admin UI and RBAC are robust and follow best practices.

## Next Steps
- (Optional) Clean up ESLint warnings for unused variables.
- Proceed with deployment or further feature development as needed.
