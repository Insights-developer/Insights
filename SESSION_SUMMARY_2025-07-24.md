# Session Summary - July 24, 2025
## Auth System Migration & User Creation Fix

### ðŸŽ¯ **Problem Solved**
- **Issue**: Users could log in but got "403 dashboard error" and "No features detected"
- **Root Cause**: Database trigger for user creation was designed but never deployed
- **Impact**: Users existed in Supabase auth but not in database tables, breaking RBAC system

### âœ… **Solution Implemented**

#### **1. Centralized Session Management Migration**
- Migrated all 13+ pages from manual `useRequireFeature` to `FeatureGate` pattern
- Updated UserInfoBox to use database profile instead of Supabase auth data
- Fixed admin pages that were completely unprotected
- All components now use AuthContext with 15-minute auto-refresh

#### **2. Database Trigger System Deployed**
- **File**: `fix_user_creation_trigger.sql` (successfully executed)
- **Access Groups**: Guest (unverified) â†’ Member (verified) based on email confirmation
- **Auto-Assignment**: New users get proper groups based on `email_confirmed_at` status
- **Auto-Promotion**: Users automatically promoted Guest â†’ Member on email verification

#### **3. RBAC Permission Structure**
```
Guest Group (Unverified Users):
- profile_page
- contact_page

Member Group (Verified Users):  
- dashboard_page
- profile_page
- contact_page
```

### ðŸ”§ **Key Files Modified**
1. **All Page Components**: Migrated to FeatureGate pattern with "âœ… CENTRALIZED SESSION MANAGEMENT" comments
2. **UserInfoBox.tsx**: Updated to fetch rich database profile via `/api/user/profile`
3. **API Routes**: Fixed `promote-if-verified` and `update-login` to handle missing user records
4. **Database**: Deployed triggers for automatic user creation and group assignment

### ðŸŽ¯ **System Status**
- **Authentication**: âœ… Centralized through AuthContext
- **User Creation**: âœ… Automatic via database triggers  
- **Group Assignment**: âœ… Verification-based (Guest/Member)
- **Permission System**: âœ… Feature-based RBAC fully functional
- **Build Status**: âœ… No errors, all components using consistent patterns

### ðŸ“‹ **Architecture Notes**
- **Session Management**: 15-minute auto-refresh, 5-minute permission caching
- **User Flow**: Signup â†’ Guest group â†’ Email verification â†’ Member group promotion
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks, standardized API responses
- **Security**: Permission checks on every page load, feature-based access control

### ðŸš€ **Next Development Priorities**
1. Test complete user registration â†’ verification â†’ login flow
2. Verify UserInfoBox shows correct group names
3. Confirm dashboard access works for verified users
4. Monitor login/permission performance
