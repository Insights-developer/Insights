# Session Log - July 26, 2025

## Major UI/UX and Architecture Updates

### Centralized Theme & Modern UI
- All main pages (Settings, Contact, Games, Profile, etc.) now use a centralized card design with CSS variables for background, border, and foreground colors.
- Removed legacy gradients and purple highlights from AuthForm and cards; all icons and headers now use theme variables or neutral colors for consistency.
- Company icon in AuthForm is now grey, not purple.
- "Welcome to Insight" label is now inside the AuthForm card and properly aligned.

### Authentication & User Info
- Login API (`/api/auth/login`) now sets the JWT as an HTTP-only cookie, enabling proper session management and user info display.
- UserInfoBox now correctly displays user information and supports logout by clearing the token cookie.
- Fixed bug where UserInfoBox showed nothing due to missing cookie.

### Build & Code Quality
- Removed all unused variable warnings in API route files (TypeScript/ESLint clean).
- All build errors and warnings resolved; production build is clean.

### CRUD Admin Pages
- Features, Access Groups, and App Config admin pages use the centralized card/table design and theme system.
- All CRUD UIs are consistent, modern, and responsive.

### Documentation
- Updated technical and component documentation to reflect new theme system, authentication flow, and UI/UX improvements.
